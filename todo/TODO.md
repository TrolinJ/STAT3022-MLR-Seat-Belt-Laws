- **Our Data set**: the data set we're given is in the *data* folder and is the `seatbelt_group_14.csv` file. I've summarised the `Data_dictionary.pdf` (which gives an outline of our data) below: 
  - Outcome/response variable (Y) is: 
    - `fatalities`: number of fatalities per million of traffic miles. So If you wanted to obtain total number of fatalities for that year do `fatalities` $\times$ `miles`
  - Predictors/covariates (X's) are: 
    - `state`: a state from America (categorical)
    - `year`: year fatalities was recorded (categorical)
    - `miles`: total miles travelled in that year in millions (nearest integer) (continuous)
    - `seatbelt`: percentage of people who used seatbelts (self reported by state) (continuous)
    - `speed65`: is there a 65 mile/hr speed sign (yes or no)? (categorical)
    - `speed70`: is there a 70 mile (or higher)/hr speed sign (yes or no)? (categorical)
    - `drinkage`: is there a minimum drinking age of 21 years (yes or no)? (categorical)
    - `alcohol`: is there a maximum of 0.08 in the blood alcohol content?
    - `income`: median income per capita (that is, per person)
    - `age`: average age
    - `enforce`: is there enforcement of seatbelts ('no', 'primary', 'secondary') (categorical)
